<!-- We created a sub-folder with a file for play_rock.html.erb (within views > game)
erb represents an embedded ruby template, so you can use tag <%= %> and write whatever ruby within it
Final result of <%= %> will be turned into a string and injected in that spot
This is how we created our first dynamic webpage!
Removing the equal sign in the initial tag allows us to run the code w/o printing it in html-->

<h1>Howdy!</h1>

<p>You played rock.</p>
